"# Vote-Application"
The application provide a platform to user submit a topic and share to other user. besides, the user also can up vote or down vote the topic.

This application totally have four user interface Home page (Show top 20 topic), Create topic page, show all Stories page and display stories page.

I am using Firebase for data storing because it can easy to see and manage the data in the website. Beside, Firebase also can help me track the error and record for anlaysing. 

In the home page and show all stories page, i use list view to list the stories and the user can click a topic you want to see and the application will show all the information what the actor wrote to you. For create topic page, the user must insert all field otherwise user cannot submit and store user's topic to database. Moreover, the application also will remain the user and ask users to fill in all field.

Espresso test is my testing method because i can write down the instruction and run it. Android Studio will help me to run it automaticlly and it will show what error i get.
